<details>
<summary><b>federated-nids</b> — network intrusion detection via federated learning</summary>
<br>

Built for 4G/5G network environments, this trains a shared detection model across simulated clients without centralizing raw traffic data.

- CICIDS2017 dataset, FedAvg aggregation
- 5-client federated simulation
- `Python` `PyTorch` `Flower`

</details>
<details>
<summary><b>linux-mem-extractor</b> — Linux Live Process Memory Extractor </summary>

A lightweight CLI tool for incident response that parses virtual memory mappings and extracts live runtime artifacts directly from `/proc` without external drivers.

- Parses memory address ranges and permission maps via `/proc/[pid]/maps`
- Directly seeks and reads raw process memory buffers in `/proc/[pid]/mem`
- Extracts ASCII string artifacts, environment variables, and in-memory secrets
- `Python` `Linux Internals` `Forensics`

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>youplay</b> — YouTube Music playlist downloader CLI</summary>
<br>

A CLI-first tool for pulling playlists down with metadata intact, because browser extensions never quite get the tagging right.

- Automated metadata + album art tagging via `mutagen`
- Clean terminal UX with `rich` and `click`
- `Python` `yt-dlp`

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>battleship-game</b> — turn-based Battleship in Java</summary>
<br>

A weekend build to shake off DSA cobwebs — grid logic, hit detection, and a scoring engine from scratch.

- 5x5 expandable grid, multiple ship sizes
- Play against AI, with replay mode
- `Java`
